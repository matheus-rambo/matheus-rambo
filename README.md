# Projects

- [r_crypto](https://github.com/iammatheusrambo/r_crypto)
  
  My open source project that makes *symmetric encryption* ease.   
  With this, you can encrypt any type of files, store message inside a encrypted file/text, so the user that decrypts it, will see you message.     
  More info, you can see at the project wiki page. :kissing: :kissing: :kissing:     
  ***Take a look! :grin:***
