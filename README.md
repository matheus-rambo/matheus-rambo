# Projects

- [DaWatcher](https://github.com/iammatheusrambo/DaWatcher)

  A simple project that let users do an action when some event occurs in a file.     
  **I use only Linux syscalls, and, users can create their own plugins.**

- [r_crypto](https://github.com/iammatheusrambo/r_crypto)
  
  My open source project that makes *symmetric encryption* ease.   
  With this, you can encrypt any type of files, store message inside a encrypted file/text, so the user that decrypts it, will see you message.     
  More info, you can see at the project wiki page. :kissing: :kissing: :kissing:     
  ***Take a look! :grin:***

  My very own Linux Terminal.

# Computer Languages
My favorite language is **`C`**, I realy became a better programmer after learning it.     
Python & Java are great to.     

But, I am a language agnostic, and, I can work with everything that I want.
