### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Java Developer, but in love with **C**/**C++** and **Assembly**.  
I like to learn about computers, operations systems, databases, data structures, computer network, and programming languages.

I have big skills in Java(well, that is my first language. I did my first [**Hello World**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) with her).  
Nowadays, I am studyng computer network, data structures, operations systems and programming languages, someday, I will create my first language(just for fun, **obviously**). And after that, create my operation system.   
For the programming language, the name is going to be: **Ramboso Lang**. And for the operation system, is going to be: **Ramboso OS**.
